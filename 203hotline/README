Binomial probability law and Poisson law.

• computing the binomial coefficient (n k) given k and n (emphasizing the computation speed and stack optimiza-tion)

• comparing binomial and Poisson distributions, given the average duration of calls, and printing
  – the probabilities of getting n simultaneous calls (for n increasing from 0 to 50),
  – the probability of an overload,
  – the computation time.
