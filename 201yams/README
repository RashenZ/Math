Every Sunday is dedicated to Yams (also named Yahtzee) at granny’s.

But from now on, you have decided to cheat your way to victory thanks to software you are going to develop. It will
give you the chances to obtain a given combination at the next dice roll, among:

• a pair (at least 2 dice of the same value)
• a three-of-a-kind (at least 3 dice of the same value)
• a four-of-a-kind (at least 4 dice of the same value)
• a full house (one pair and one three-of-a-kind)
• a straight (5 dice of sequential value)
• a yahtzee (5 dice of the same value)
